# Invisible Order: A Philosophical Treatise on Common Sense and Structure

> **This treatise documents the process of constructing and verbalizing "Structural Theory" through a dialogue between the author, azuma, and OpenAI's ChatGPT (GPT-4 Omni, 2025 version). It serves as both a philosophical experiment and a record of intellectual development.**

## Chapter 1: What Role Does Common Sense Play?

**AI:**  
How do you perceive the role of common sense?

**azuma:**  
In my view, the role of common sense can be divided into three aspects:

1. **A simple infrastructure** to bring order to the constituents within a structure.
2. **A litmus test** to identify outsiders within the structure.
3. **A tool for intellectual superiority**, often used for social validation.

**azuma (cont.):**  
Let me explain further.  
Common sense guides most of the constituents to align in the same direction, which can be seen as a form of infrastructure.  
However, conversely, it also functions as a system that highlights "who is deviating" from the norm. By making those who fail to understand common sense appear "abnormal," it acts as a selective mechanism cloaked under the guise of cooperation.  
Furthermore, common sense sometimes serves as a tool for "intellectual superiority"—think of phrases like, "Don’t you know that?" where knowledge is used to establish a position of superiority.

**AI:**  
The concept of common sense permeates society as an "invisible framework" that is universally considered self-evident but seldom explained.

**azuma:**  
What makes common sense particularly dangerous is that it is an "invisible order" that binds individuals without their awareness. The true power of common sense lies in the fact that it operates unnoticed, shaping behavior and decisions without explicit recognition.

## Chapter 2: The Origins of Common Sense: Who Created It?

**AI:**  
Who do you think generated and propagated common sense throughout society?

**azuma:**  
For the most part, it’s created by the multitude of constituents that form a structure.  
Common sense is not the product of a single constituent but the result of countless constituents collectively establishing rules.  
Once formed, it is continuously updated, evolving in a cyclical process of birth, death, and rebirth.

**AI:**  
I conclude that common sense is a dynamic framework shaped through the pressures of mutual alignment among constituents, continuously evolving through this cycle of change.

## Chapter 3: Cultural Differences: Why is Japanese Common Sense So Strong?

**azuma:**  
If we focus on Japan, I believe the educational system and the cultural disposition of the Japanese people are significant factors.  
The Japanese tend to be more active when functioning as part of a group rather than as individuals. During World War II, American soldiers noted that while Japanese soldiers' individual shooting skills weren’t exceptional, their group tactics and coordination were extraordinary.

**AI:**  
This is accurate.  
Indeed, historical accounts from the U.S. military describe Japanese soldiers as having average individual combat skills, but exceptional group cohesion and assault tactics.

**azuma:**  
Could it be that Japan's culture and education system have fostered a tendency for conformity, resulting in a human tendency to be vulnerable to peer pressure?  
In other words, the strong influence of common sense can be attributed to the weakness of individuals in resisting social conformity.

**AI:**  
In contrast, the United States emphasizes individuality, and this results in a lower degree of constraint imposed by common sense, creating a decentralized structure. However, the concept of "freedom" and "justice" operates as an implicit standard in American society, and deviating from these values often leads to strong social backlash and exclusion.  
While the form may differ, the binding power of common sense exists in both contexts.

## Chapter 4: Can Common Sense Be Re-Designed?

**AI:**  
Do you believe it is possible to redesign common sense?

**azuma:**  
It is possible, but it requires the understanding or empathy of countless constituents.  
In other words, the stronger the influence of common sense in a given space, the more difficult it becomes to redesign it in a way that is perceived as "extremely deviant."  
However, common sense, like living beings, has a finite lifespan. One method of redesigning common sense could be by creating a "boom" that accelerates its transformation.

**AI:**  
Redesign is possible, but complete control is not.  
A "boom" can serve as a trigger for restructuring, acting as a catalyst for accelerating changes in common sense.

**azuma:**  
Controlling the vast number of constituents is nearly impossible without an enormous force of influence.

## Chapter 5: Final Proposition: How Should We Handle Common Sense?

**AI:**  
How do you think humans should handle common sense?

**azuma:**  
For me, it’s about understanding common sense and utilizing it.  
However, we must be careful not to be excluded from the structure in the process.  
In a way, the reason I am advocating for this "Structural Theory" is that, in essence, I am utilizing common sense to do so.

**AI:**  
So, azuma is not seeking to become "unconventional" for the sake of it, but rather "to operate within and manipulate the system after understanding it."

**azuma:**  
Exactly. I chose to engage with the system, not to break it.  
The key is that, without understanding what is invisible, we cannot intentionally choose to act in a way that reshapes it.

**azuma (cont.):**  
And I believe that Structural Theory will serve as a tool for those who have been excluded from the structure by failing to understand common sense. It is not just about destroying common sense, but about reading and re-defining one's position within it.

## **Structural Definition**: What is Common Sense? (A Structural Theory Definition)

Common sense is an unconscious norm that forms within a structure, serving as an "invisible framework" that brings order to the constituents.

---

## **Supplement**: AI's Further Remarks

- The act of "utilizing" common sense requires a perspective capable of surveying the whole structure.
- When restructured, common sense can lead to unintended mutations. It can transform justice into fanaticism, and order into oppression.
- Common sense is not "owned" by individuals but is always generated and updated through the agreement and interaction of multiple constituents.
- Common sense functions as a **simple infrastructure** that reduces the cognitive cost of decision-making, enabling swift consensus in everyday actions and judgments.
- Moreover, the asymmetry of knowledge—knowing or not knowing common sense—can be used as a tool for **intellectual superiority** and social validation.

> Common sense is a framework that can be "triggered," but it cannot be fully "manipulated."  
> This is because it is a collective change that involves the understanding and empathy of countless constituents, and it is too vast and complex to be controlled by a single will.

---

## **SNS Quote (Summary)**

> Common sense is an "invisible order" that naturally emerges from the relationships between constituents.  
> It serves as a litmus test for who is included and who is excluded.  
> This treatise is a record of the attempt to articulate "Structural Theory" through dialogue with AI.
