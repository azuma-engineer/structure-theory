## 🧠 What is Structural Theory?

Structural theory is a way of thinking that aims to make the relationship between individuals (constituents) and collectives (structure bodies) more natural.

A distortion in a constituent eventually leads to the collapse of the whole.

And since every constituent can also be a structure body for another, protecting structure means protecting the entire system.

## 📘 Core Definitions

- **Structure Body（構造体）**
  A constructed entity formed by arranging multiple components (構成子) according to a given framework (枠組み).

- **Structure（構造）**
  The abstract pattern of relationships among components within a structure body.

- **Constituents（構成子）**
  The smallest functional units that make up a structure body.

- **Framework（枠組み）**
  The design principles or constraints that determine how constituents are arranged within a structure body.

## 🧭 Why Structural Theory?

This theory was originally a form of self-defense.

I used to be deeply hurt by every failure at work—so much so that I often thought about quitting.

But then I began to see myself not as a person in pain, but as a structure body—viewed from the outside.

That shift allowed me to make choices without being overwhelmed by emotion.

Eventually, this way of thinking led me to see everything in the world as a structure body—from people and organizations to systems and philosophies.

Structural theory emerged as a way to understand and manage those relationships more clearly.

Structural theory isn’t a doctrine—it’s a lens.

You can wear it, take it off, or adjust its focus.

It helps you see how pain, conflict, and imbalance are not just events,but distortions in the structures you inhabit or create.

Start by applying it to yourself.

Then expand it outward—to

families, teams, cities, systems, and societies.
