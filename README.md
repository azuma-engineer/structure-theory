# 🧠 Structure Theory: Core Definitions & Philosophical Framework

This repository is dedicated to the formalization and development of **Structure Theory** — a philosophical framework that redefines how we perceive systems, organizations, and individuals through four core concepts:  
**Structure Body**, **Constituents**, **Framework**, and **Structure**.

These definitions were collaboratively developed through conversations between azuma and ChatGPT (GPT-4, 2025).
